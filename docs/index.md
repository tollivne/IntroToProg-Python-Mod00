# Hello World

**Dev:** *N. Tolliver*

On April 16, 2020, I created my first Python program.  In programming, it is traditional for your first program to print out: "Hello World."

Although this is very simple code, it required downloading and installing the Python interpreter, learning how to use the Integrated Development Environment, and running the code.  The code is shown in Figure 1.

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
*Figure 1 - Code to print "Hello World"*  

The output is shown in Figure 2.

So, that's it.  My first Python program!
